<h1 align="center">🎓 Student Habits & Performance Analysis (Power BI Project)</h1>
Welcome to the Student Habits & Performance Analysis project! This Power BI dashboard dives into the behavioral and lifestyle factors affecting student academic performance. Built as part of a hands-on data storytelling initiative, the project uses real-world BI practices to present insights around health, technology usage, family background, and study patterns.

## 📘 About the Project

This project analyzes survey data from 1,000 students to discover how their habits—such as sleep, study time, internet use, and diet—impact their academic results. The goal was to convert structured CSV data into an insightful and interactive report using Power BI’s data visualization capabilities.

## 📂 Data Source

- **student_habits_performance.csv**: The dataset includes fields like student grades, sleep/study hours, gender, diet quality, mental health, parental education, internet quality, co-curricular participation, and entertainment habits.

## 📌 What You'll Find in the Report

- **A high-level summary of student metrics using KPIs:**
  - **Total Students**: 1,000  
  - **Average Study Time**: 3.55 hours  
  - **Minimum Score**: 18.4  
  - **Low Scorers**: 42 students (grade D or below)  

- 🔍 **Summary of Insights**
  - Most students scored in the B, A, or A+ range, with very few in C or D.
  - Gender distribution is nearly balanced across all age groups.
  - Students with high parental education tend to perform better.
  - Good internet access and a fair diet quality positively correlate with higher scores.
  - Mentally fit students and CCA participants exhibit better habits and reduced screen time.
  - Watching Netflix is more common among students not involved in extracurricular activities.
  - Study and sleep hours show clear patterns across gender, age, and grade level.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX** for calculations and metrics
- **CSV** format for raw data
- **Visual Elements**: KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, stacked columns, slicers, and line charts
